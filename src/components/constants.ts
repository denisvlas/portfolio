      "The binarization model uses a modified U-Net architecture with a frozen MobileNetV2 encoder (ImageNet pre-trained) for transfer learning. Training data consists of 224x224 pixel document images with corresponding binary masks from Google Drive. The model implements sophisticated data augmentation including random horizontal/vertical flips, hue adjustments, and innovative synthetic contrast blur generation using 10 random sinusoidal frequencies to simulate realistic document degradation. Training uses Adam optimizer with learning rate 1e-3, binary crossentropy loss, early stopping (patience=10), and learning rate reduction on plateau. The system includes nondeterministic binarization during training (random thresholds 0-255) for improved generalization. For inference, an 8-way test-time augmentation wrapper applies rotations and flips, averaging predictions for robust results. Post-training calibration uses isotonic regression to convert model logits into calibrated probabilities with reliability diagrams. The final model exports to multiple formats (SavedModel, H5, TensorFlow.js) and processes images via 224x224 patches with 4-directional augmentation for handling arbitrary input sizes. GPU optimization includes TF_FORCE_GPU_ALLOW_GROWTH for memory management and batch processing for efficiency.",
